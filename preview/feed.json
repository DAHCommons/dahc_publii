SCAMP allows the composer to engage with a ensemble of virtual acoustic and electronic instruments, quickly auditioning and iterating over musical ideas based on the sonic result. If desired, the composer can then flexibly quantize and export the music in western notation.</p>\n<p class=\"align-left\" dir=\"ltr\">SCAMP provides varied and highly extensible utilities for playback, features easy playback and notation of microtonality and glissandi, has a flexible clock system capable of coordinating multiple streams of music following separate tempo curves, and can export notation in the form of either MusicXML or Lilypond (via the abjad library). The goal is to provide the composer with a streamlined workflow while imposing as little as possible from an aesthetic standpoint.\"</p>\n</address>\n<p><img class=\"post__image\" src=\"file:///Users/kramerelwell/Documents/Publii/sites/dahc_publii2/preview/media/posts/10/DD_Marc-Evanstein_800.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"1035\"> </p>",

It is a 4-year grant (2016-2020) and a strand in the <strong>Creative Multilingualism</strong> initiative.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Ethan Turpin uses old and new media technologies to explore human perceptions within large systems. He is dedicated to making learning spaces where people of all ages can engage in contemplation. Working as an independent video producer and artist since 1999, his projects have spanned topics such as climate crisis in 3D at The California Museum of Photography, to geometric growth at The Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics.</p>\n<p>In 2017 he installed three interactive “Video Organisms” at the Wolf Museum of Experience and Innovation (MOXI). In his current collaborations with fire researchers at UCSB’s Bren School for Environmental Science and Management, Ethan films wildfire incidents and produces user-controlled visualizations with support from the National Science Foundation.</p>\n<p>Ethan studied sculpture at the Victoria College of Art in Melbourne, Australia and received a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in 1997 from the Kansas City Art Institute.</p>",

In the act of creative thinking, it tracks a circular history of print from the common hand-operated pull press, through digital technology, to 3D reproduction—the artifacts of which we integrate back into early printing practices. 3D plastic images and letters sit alongside metal movable type from all historical periods, together with wooden hand-carved illustrations in the “forme” of the press bed, ready for the “kiss” of the heavy tympan onto the paper laid upon the forme which produces the printed sheet.The pride of the Maker Lab is Mad Madge, a reconstruction of an early 19th-century Albion pull press, named after the eccentric Margaret “Mad Madge” Cavendish, poet, fiction-writer, and inquiring mind, most active in the 1650s.
